RideScout is an app that provides users with a platform to track their rides, share cool destinations, and connect with other riders. Upon creating an account, users can add vehicles to their profile and start tracking their rides using the app's GPS functionality. They can also post about their favorite destinations, sharing photos and details of their experiences. One unique feature of RideScout is the ability to follow other public accounts. By following other riders, users can see the rides and locations they publicly share. This provides a way to discover new routes, hidden gems, and popular destinations recommended by fellow riders. Users can like and comment on others' rides, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie among riders. When exploring the map, users can click on popular destinations to view posts from riders who have visited those places. This allows users to see a collection of images and experiences shared by the community at each specific location. By combining ride tracking, destination sharing, and social features, RideScout aims to create a vibrant community of riders who can inspire and connect with one another through their shared passion for exploring the world on two wheels.
Riders can also post bikes they have for sale to HogHub, and dealerships can do the same for a monthly fee. The other monetized aspect of the marketplace will be gear for sale with discount codes for RideScoutâ€™s users, earning RideScout income through affiliate marketing.
