      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        RideScout understands that transactions on HogHub will largely take place off-platform, including but not limited to cash deals where users meet up, digital money transfers, and checks. Exercise caution when contacting people you do not know, one of the main benefits of RideScout is that you can view the other personâ€™s profile - if it seems suspicious, treat it as such and avoid the transaction.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        When making an in-person transaction with another user, inform someone you know that you are doing so. RideScout recommends meeting in a public place.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        When purchasing a product that is not from the RideScout store, we cannot guarantee that it will be exactly as advertised. If you make a purchase and it is faulty, you can contact jared@ridescout.net and we can investigate the account. However, we will not be able to insure or refund your purchases made on our marketplace from other users.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a safe and thriving community for all RideScout users. Thank you for your cooperation and support.
